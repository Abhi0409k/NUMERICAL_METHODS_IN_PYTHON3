# NUMERICAL_METHODS_IN_PYTHON3
Below are the list of few important and fundamental numerical methods codes in python3 (few libraries imported). Most of these can be directly implemented with little to no modifications. These are generally written from bookish algorithms from scratch. More material will be added once it is done. 

Feel free to contact if facing any difficulty.

3. Everything else (will mention specifically for specific methods #see the code files).
